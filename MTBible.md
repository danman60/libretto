# BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop Notes
**Craft Related Material & Styles to Emulate**

## 1. Core Principles of American Musical Theatre

* **The Goal:** American Musical Theatre uses book songs to illuminate character and tell a story. It is a melodic craft.
* **Melodic Form:** Melody needs FORM to support it. The 8-bar length is deeply rooted in the Western ear, representing the natural length of a statement.
* **The Chorus:** Songs are entire moments that connect choruses. The CHORUS is the central element of the song.
* **Standard Structure (AABA):**
    * A - Statement
    * A - Restatement
    * B - Contrast
    * A - Recapitulation/conclusion
* **The DOs:** Write melodically, use a structured musical world, support and enhance the words, and be fresh (don't recycle).
* **The DON'Ts:** Avoid cliches, relying entirely on genre (which has its own associations), and parody. Don't rely on chord symbols.
* **Progression:** Show progression by reframing the repeating chorus. This gives the audience mental breathing room.
* **Bad Structure Traps:**
    * *Too Short:* 16 bars total (4-bar sections). This is too broad, under-dramatic, and not great for character development (common in folk/pop).
    * *Too Long:* 64 bars total (16 sections). Often found in art songs or pop ballads.
* **The Hook:** A strong hook must have one single, big idea.

### Pat's 10 Commandments of MT Lyrics
1.  **Thou shalt be singable.** It is a joy for a singer to sing a song written for the stage. Singable means sustained. "Try to sing it so fast it cannot be understood." - Lerner.
2.  **Thou shalt be understandable.** Musical theatre is not opera; you must understand the lyric. If the audience has to stop and think, you've lost them already.
3.  **Thou shalt be about one thing and one thing only.** That one thing should be encapsulated in the hook. Embrace the subtlety of subtext. The secret to musical theatre is learning how to say "I love you" in a new/fresh way.
4.  **Thou shalt be specific.** Specifics capture audience attention and make a song memorable.
5.  **Thou shalt write dramatically.** Ideas of lyrics should be placed in ascending order of "punch". Write backwards for progression. Lyrics should end up in a different place.
6.  **Thou shalt not self-pity (except in comedy).** Audiences don't pity self-pityers, so keep it positive. In comedy, if complaining, make it FUNNY; too much tragedy becomes funny.
7.  **Thou shalt not misaccent (thou shalt correctly scan).**
8.  **Thou shalt find fresh images.**
9.  **Thou shalt not false rhyme or transpose words.** "Familiarity breeds content" - Sondheim.
10. **Thou shalt not be rigid or wordy.** Lyrics shouldn't look "square". Characters make up lyrics as they go along spontaneously.

## 2. Pacing and Story Structure

* **Pacing the Tension:** The line of tension should not be a straight diagonal line upward; that is not a good way to pace. At the beginning of each act, there should be a dip or relaxation in tension before building to the climax.

* **Screenplay Structure:**
    * *Act I (0-30 mins):* Setup.
    * *Act II (30-95 mins):* Starts and continues action. *Note: Act 2 can sometimes be too long, splitting into an Act II (30-60) and Act III (60-95).*
    * *Act III (95-120 mins):* Acceleration to the end. Features the climax. The resolution scene sits from 115 to 120.
* **Classic Musicals Model:**
    * *Act I:* Setup. All characters have an "I Am" song.
    * *Act II:* Starts the action and builds to a "Point of No Return" where things can't go back to the way they were. This is followed by Intermission.
    * *Act III:* Can be long, often split into mini-acts.
* **Five Act Structure (Terence, Roman Playwright):** A big influence for Shakespeare.
    * *Act I:* Set up.
    * *Act II:* Start of action. Preliminary and counter moves preceding main battle.
    * *Act III:* Opposition makes chief assault and seems to have victory.
    * *Act IV:* Counterattack. Opposition loses, but heroes have not officially won.
    * *Act V:* Heroes win.

## 3. Song Types and Archetypes

### A. The Charm Song (Moment of Relief)
* **Purpose:** A charm song acts as a moment of relief. It doesn't move the plot forward, is more generic, and has a steady beat and optimistic point of view. It allows the audience to sit back and relax. The melody is more important than the lyric. It represents a pause in the action and gives a break from the main characters.
* **Placement:** Can occur after something significant. In Act 1: after all characters are introduced and before action begins, seldom early. In Act 2: opening of the act.
* **Approaches:** 1) Group excitement song. 2) A celebration. 3) A moment of relaxed fun. 4) A comment/observation on the world of the show.

### B. The Comedy Song
* **The Secret:** If you say comedy, it won't be funny. Comedy should come in the side door. The more you dissect comedy, the more it goes away. "A comedy song is where the audience laughs out loud ha-ha." - Lehman.
* **Musical/Lyrical Balance:** Lyrics take center stage. Music should get out of the way of the lyric. The more the music calls attention to itself, the less chance the lyric has to be funny. Tempo is generally at the rate of speech (can be faster but seldom slower).
* **Rules:** Comedy comes from TRUTH. It often comes from pain/discomfort. The angle of vision is just off the norm. Based on disappointed expectations. Comedy songs should get funnier as they go along (save best items for the end).
* **Malice & Target:** Never write without malice; darkness and anguish are fundamental. Ensure you are laughing at ourselves vs. laughing at others. Use humor at the expense of those in power ("punching up"). Humor at the expense of the victim is NOT FUNNY.
* **Decluttering:** Decluttering words and notes helps with clarity, comprehensibility, singability, memorableness, resonance, and melody absorption. It leaves room for the composer to write all of the notes underneath.

### C. Character Establishment Songs ("I Am" / "I Want")
* **First Assignment Guidelines:** You are not necessarily singing about the character themselves. Must be AABA. No power ballads (too early). Not part of a musical scene. It represents the starting point of the character (they may end the show in a totally different place). Non-diegetic. It doesn't have to tell everything, just one particular thing.

### D. The 10-Minute Musical (Character in the News)
* **Parameters:** Cannot exceed 12-13 mins. Must be complete and self-contained (beginning-middle-end). Use songs, not sung-dialogue.
* **Rules:** Must be a human singing to another human(s), not to the audience. Based on a true story from a news source from the last 6 months. Contemporary vernacular with traditional 32 bar chorus form. Book song for the stage.

## 4. Musical Composition & The Partnership

### Specificity
* **World Building:** Creates its own world, time, place, and tone throughout the piece, and stays true to that. Avoid copying the time and place of setting, as that is just one of many filters.
* **In Music:** Step away from the piano. Avoid cliches (the enemy of specificity). Ask: what is distinctive about this song? Avoid excessive arpeggiation (using the piano as a guitar). Don't write for chord symbols. Make sure there is a progression in the accompaniment (forward motion, thin to thick).

### Developing Piano Accompaniment
* **The Hands:** The Left Hand (LH) and Right Hand (RH) are your entire orchestra.
    * *Right Hand:* Concentration of notes, ninth range. One finger holds a "thumb note" while others move.
    * *Left Hand:* Tenth range, thinner, arpeggiation. Not too much distance between notes.
* **Groove & Spareness:** Focus on the creation and sustenance of a rhythmic groove. Spareness is important (especially at the beginning vs. thick ends). Don't write at the piano; have someone else play it.
* **Cabaret:** In cabaret songs, you must establish the entire world right away.

### End of a Chorus & Song
* **Chorus Ending:** There needs to be something that acts as a spark OR SURPRISE. The chorus must have a sense of being a complete entity. Sequence: Establish idea, Repeat idea, Contrast idea, Conclude idea. End by: an extension of the final A (tag), introducing a high note, a lyrical shift, or a new chord in the idea.
* **Song Ending:** Usually ends with a coda. Can be short or long (usually 4 measures). The Stinger/Button usually falls on beat 7, 9, OR 1.

### The Partnership of Music & Lyrics
* At their best, music and lyrics work together to mature and enhance each other.
* The length of the lyrical statement has to match the length of the musical phrase.
* *Note:* When you sing an obscenity, it's ten times bigger than speaking.
* *Note:* If you phrase something in the negative, it's less effective than the positive.
* *Note:* No one can hear your comma OR semi-colon.

### Collaboration Best Practices
* **Setup:** Before writing, talk about how you work best together, set deadlines, and discuss feedback. Create a timeline together and build a safe exchange/partnership.
* **The Process:** 1) Decide topic and placement. 2) Title. 3) Lyricist writes prose of song structure. 4) Composer writes ideas for at least an A section. 5) Get together, play ideas, discuss. 6) Composer writes chorus. 7) Decide how many choruses, verses, extensions, etc.
* **Attitude:** Be understanding; composing and notating is time-consuming and hard. Composers should be rigid about scansion (abandoning melodic rhythm weakens the song). Lyricists should be rigid about meaning and tone.
* **Good Collaborators:** Forget where ideas come from, are totally in sync, "that's it!"
* **Bad Collaborators:** Are too different, share too little, can't connect, don't meet in person, don't give enough time to work, make partners feel small, or insist on completed ideas (MUSIC OR LYRIC) before starting.
* **Rhyming & Execution:** Rhyme between stanzas. When you're too on-the-nose and over-rhyming, there's not much for the audience to listen to and feel like they're learning. Use the dictionary for alliteration. Save writing dance breaks for a production; they lose any listener before.

## 5. Styles to Emulate (Reference Examples)

### A. Subtext Example
* **People Will Say We're In Love (Rodgers & Hammerstein)**
    * *Laurey lists "don'ts" to Curly to prove their love is untrue, actually revealing it:* "Don't throw bouquets at me / Don't please my folks too much / Don't laugh at my jokes too much / People will say we're in love..."

### B. Song Forms: AABA
* **Waitin' for My Dearie (Lerner & Loewe)**
    * *(A)* Waitin' for my dearie / An' happy am I / To hold my heart till he comes strollin' by
    * *(A)* When he comes, my dearie / One look an' I'll know / That he's the dearie I've been wantin' so
    * *(B)* Though I'll live forty lives / Till the day he arrives / I'll not ever, ever grieve... *(Notes: More Movement, More chromatic, inverted intervals, Propells into final A)*
    * *(A)* There's a laddie weary / An' wanderin' free *(Notes: slight surprise, shortening, lyrical conclusion)*
* **To Life (Bock & Harnick)**
    * Features a *new note* on the end of the second A section, leading into a B section questioning joyful panting, and resolving back to A.
* **Never Never Land (Styne, Comden & Green)**
    * Features a B section that relies on contrast/echo ("You'll have a treasure... More precious far than gold") and a final A section with the same interval, lengthened for conclusion.

### C. Song Forms: ABAB / ABAC
* **It's De-Lovely (Cole Porter)**
    * *(A)* The night is young, the skies are clear... It's de-lovely
    * *(B)* You can tell at a glance / What a swell night this is for romance... *(Notes: Rhythmic break, basis of B)*
    * *(A)* So please be sweet, my chickadee... It's delectable, it's delirious / It's dilemma, it's de limit / It's deluxe, it's de-lovely *(Notes: extension)*
* **A Weekend in the Country (Stephen Sondheim)**
    * A "persuading song" where stanzas musically need each other and are gradually rising. Melodically parallel echos in the B section.
* **Cool (Bernstein & Sondheim)**
    * *(A)* Boy, boy, crazy boy / Get cool, boy... *(Notes: 2 PARALLEL LINES)*
    * *(B)* Don't get hot / 'Cause man, you've got / Some high times ahead... *(Notes: CONTRAST)*
    * *(B')* But not like a yo-yo schoolboy / Just play it cool, boy / Real cool *(Notes: SURPRISE)*
* **Mame (Jerry Herman)**
    * The rhythm and melody of the beginning A is directly echoed in the beginning of B.
* *Other highlighted ABAB/ABAC structures:* Put On a Happy Face (Adams & Strouse), Hey, Look Me Over (Leigh & Coleman), You'll Never Get Away From Me (Styne & Sondheim).

### D. Specificity in Dialogue & Lyrics vs. "Gist"
* **Death of a Salesman:** * *The Gist:* He was a salesman. He traveled all the time. When his customers didn't buy, it was the end of the world. If his clothes were dowdy, he was finished.
    * *As Written (Specifics!):* Willy was a salesman... He don't put a bolt to a nut, he don't tell you the law or give you medicine. He's the man way out there in the blue riding on a smile and a shoeshine. And when they start not smiling back - that's an earthquake...
* **The Most Happy Fella (They Knew What They Wanted):** Instead of just saying "I travelled everywhere," Joey specifies: "Cherries an' hops - melons down in the Imperial an' oranges down south an' the railroad an' the oilfields..."
* **Good vs. Bad Specificity:**
    * *Bad (Sweethearts, Babes in Toyland):* Blocky, vague/not specific, archaic. Nobody talks like this. No direction - not dramatic. No fresh images. ("If you ask where love is found / The sort of love that's fond and true...")
    * *Good (Not While I'm Around):* Time and rhyme have significance. Essentially says "I love you" but with fresh images ("Demons are prowling / Everywhere / Nowadays / I'll send 'em howling...")

### E. Scene Construction Examples
* **"A Boy Like That" (West Side Story):** Dramatic setup bleeding directly into song, hitting emotional peaks immediately.
* **"What's Playin' at the Roxy" (Guys and Dolls):** A textbook Charm Song, bouncing between characters listing highly specific, character-driven scenarios about men changing for dolls.
* **"Sing" (A Chorus Line):** A masterclass in a Comedy Song built on a character limitation (Al and Kristine finishing each other's out-of-tune phrases).
* **"Shall We Dance?" (The King and I):** Musical scene showing tension, persuasion, and discovery built into the structure of learning a dance.
* **"A Healthy Normal American Boy" (Bye Bye Birdie):** Shows how the same musical sequence can be repeated 4x while stakes and intensity increase. "Refrain is the hook, anchor, homebase".
* **"No Place Like London" (Sweeney Todd):** Uses a mini chorus (diatonic), descending half-steps for the Beggar Woman, and specific thematic markers (Anthony's theme) bleeding out of dialogue.
* **"If I Loved You" (Carousel):** Extensive park bench scene demonstrating how to transition naturally from long, winding prose/dialogue ("We don't count at all...") into a sweeping AABA chorus.

### F. Character Establishment Song Examples
*(Note: These establish the starting point of the character, not necessarily where they end up)*
* *A Little Brains, A Little Talent* (Damn Yankees)
* *Some People* (Gypsy)
* *My Shot* (Hamilton)
